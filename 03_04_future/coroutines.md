# Coroutines in C++

Split into two layers:
1. Compiler support layer
    - A standardized interface to talk to the compiler
    - You have to define a coroutine promise
    - You have to define classes that use the promise (e.g. future, generator)
    - The compiler translates `co_return`, `co_yield` and `co_await` statements to code that calls your defined classes
    - This is complicated, so we'll skip this
2. Library layer
    - Assume someone did the complicated stuff above
    - Now you have a usable coroutine library
    - This is what we'll talk about

---

# Coroutine libraries

- You can not practically use the barebones coroutines in C++
- You must implement a library on top
    - This means you can have different interfaces and capabilities for different coro libraries
- The catch: C++ does not have a standard one yet
    - Worse: there are not many open source ones either
- We'll use a fictional library for code examples:
    - It defined `task<T>`
    - It also defined `generator<T>`

# What is a coroutine?

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

In short: a function that can be paused and resumed later

This is the simplest coroutine:
```c++
task<int> zero(int value) {
    std::cout << "Hi from coroutine!" << std::endl;
    co_return 0;
}
```

You can "call" it from a function:
```c++
void function() {
    task<int> tsk = zero();
    std::cout << "Hi from function!" << std::endl;
    int value = tsk.get();
}
```

</div>
<div>

What happens here:
1. `zero()` spawns the coroutine, but it's initially paused
2. The code of `function` continues immediately, without executing the coroutine
3. The coroutine executes somewhere else (on another thread maybe)
4. `function` retrieves the result of the coroutine
    - It may also blocks to wait if the result is not ready yet

Possible output:
```
Hi from function!
Hi from coroutine!
```

</div>
</div>

# Combining coroutines

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

Consider two coroutines:

```c++
task<int> produce_value() {
    int value = ...; // Complex stuff
    co_return value;
}

task<int> process_value() {
    int init = ...; // Complex stuff
    task<int> tsk = produce_value();
    int value = co_await tsk;
    int result = ...; // Complex stuff
    co_return result;
}
```

</div>
<div>

What happens in `process_value`:
1. Does initialization
2. Spawns coroutine
3. Pauses itself
    - And tell `tsk` it's waiting for it

Later, possibly in another thread:
1. `produce_value` finishes executing, passes its result in `tsk`
2. `tsk` sees `process_value` is waiting for it
3. `tsk` resumes `process_value`
4. `process_value` retrieves the result in `tsk` (`value = co_await ...`)
5. `process_value` does its complex stuff

</div>
</div>

# Coroutines as user space threads

A thread can be in these states:
- Running: a CPU core is currently walking through its instructions
- Paused: no CPU *should* be working on it
- Ready: a CPU core can pick it up, if it has capacity

**Observe:** a coroutine can be in these exact same states!

Difference:
- A CPU core switching from one thread to the other is expensive
    - Must go through the operating system kernel and thread scheduler
- A CPU core switching from one coroutine to the other is cheap
    - Just save the state of the current one, load the state of the next, and go
- Coroutines basically realize a cooperative thread scheduler purely in user space
    - This is much lighter weight than the  preemptive kernel scheduler

---

# Use cases for task-like coroutines

- Scaling event-driven systems: large number of small jobs, does not saturate CPU capacity
    - Think of a web server
    - You could launch a thread for each client
    - Threads are resource heavy, this doesn't scale
    - Launch a coroutine for each client instead. You can have millions of coroutines at the same time without issue.
- Efficiently scheduling parallel work: medium number of heavy jobs, spins all cores at 100%
    - Think of a game engine
    - Many tasks, many of them parallel-decomposable:
        - Process sound: convolution reverb, mixing...
        - Update physics engine: space partitioning, detect collisions...
        - Update graphics engine: occlusion culling, issue render commands...
    - You can reframe the tasks as coroutines that `co_await` each other
    - Set a thread-pool to eagerly *resume* 'ready' coroutines from a global queue

# Generators

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

Coroutines also help lazy-generating sequences:
```c++
generator<int> fibonacci() {
    int a = 1, b = 1;
    while (true) {
        co_yield a;
        std::tie(a, b) = std::tuple(b, a + b);
    }
}
```

```c++
generator<int> g = fibonacci()
auto fib_n = begin(g); // Iterator!
for (int i=0; i<100; ++i) {
    std::cout << *fib_n << std::endl;
    ++fib_n;
}
```

</div>
<div>

- `co_yield`:
    - Pauses the coroutine like `co_await`
    - Creates a result like `co_return`
    - Not waiting for another coro, manually resumed
- `generator<T>`:
    - It's a *range*: has `begin()` and `end()` methods
    - These return iterators to the values in the range
    - The range is made up of the values `co_yield`ed
- Lifecycle generators:
    1. Spawn the coroutine: start in a running state
    2. Hits `co_yield`, produces a value and pauses
    3. Dereference iterator: extract the latest `co_yield`'ed value
    4. Increment iterator: resume coroutine until next `co_yield`

</div>
</div>

# Use cases for generators

- Express procedurally generated infinite sequences (e.g. random numbers)
- Iterate over data structures: may be more convenient to express it as a coroutine than directly with `iterator` classes
- Awaitable generators:
    - Instead of dereferencing the iterator, you `co_await` it
    - Your web-client's requests can be expressed as a generator

# Remarks

- This was a very brief introduction, there is a lot more to it:
    - How to implement `task<T>` and `generator<T>` yourself
    - How to implement a coroutine scheduler
    - Theory of operation of threads
    - Theory of operation of stackful and stackless coroutines
- To use coroutines in practice, you need a library that implements `task<T>` and `generator<T>`
    - You can write your own
    - You can use:

        - libcoro: https://github.com/jbaldwin/libcoro
